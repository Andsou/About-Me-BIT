                <h2>C# Programming 2</h2>
                <p>C# was pretty similar to Java so the learning curve wasn't that bad. The first 3 quarters of the course was honestly pretty easy until we got into windows forms application programming. I did decent on the first form but the next one with data binding I didn't do so well.</p>
                <p>The first half of the course was building your financial classes so that you can use them for the windows forms application. Overall, I learned a lot, but module 6 could've been reworked with more lectures as students in the past have constantly struggled with this module.</p>

                <h2>Web Development 1</h2>
                <p>The first half of this course is just html and css. I felt a little lost though at the start because it was fast paced. First we learned about margin/padding and then all of a sudden we moved to flexbox which I think is a very important concept and we only spent one module on it. I started enjoying this course more when I learned the core concepts of html and css on a separate website called The Odin Project.</p>
                <p>The second half was JavaScript and it was confusing at the start but I actually found the form validation part fun because it's a real life example of what everyone does when shopping online or filling out online forms.</p>

                <h2>Database Management Systems 1</h2>
                <p>the instructor Mike Poitras is by far the best instructor this term. He's been through this program before so he understands the hard modules and tries his best to explain or take more time on the hard modules. I also had him for IBIT math and he was still a great instructor even while teaching something else.</p>
                <p>We learned basic queries at the start and then transitioned to more complex queries like JOIN statements, functions, and sub queries.</p>

            <div class="skill-descriptions">
                <h2>Networking 1</h2>
                <p>My least favourite class. Nothing against networking but I came into BIT for software development so having a networking course was kind of annoying. Maybe the college should have it's own software development diploma because software development and networking are two different specialties.</p>
                <p>If someone loved networking but hated programming then this course is a big no no. But then again, the course specifies that a student will gain experience in multiple fields.</p>

                <h2>OO Systems Analysis</h2>
                <p>Boring class. Learned how to make UML diagrams. The instructor was very chill though.</p>

            <div class="skill-descriptions">
                <h2>Professional Development 2</h2>
                <p>Most forgettable class. Course should be removed as you only do 2 meaningful assignments in FOUR months. Resumes and a mock interview. It's also hard to care for this class when every other class decides to dump like 10 projects near the end and this course is pass/fail so it doesn't even count towards your GPA.</p>
                <p>Bailey, the instructor is pretty chill though. Easy on marking and doesn't care that much about formatting.</p>
